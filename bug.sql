The following SQL query attempts to use a variable in the SELECT statement without properly declaring or defining it within the query's scope.  This often leads to syntax errors or unexpected behavior depending on the specific database system:

```sql
SELECT col1, col2, @myVariable FROM myTable;
```

The variable `@myVariable` is not defined within the context of this SELECT statement.
